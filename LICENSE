Pear eLicense v1.3

Terminology:
pastaOS - the OS we made
We/our/us - Pear Computer LLC.
End user - you and other people
Pear ID - The account for every Pear service
Product - a product or service made by Pear

Cans:
Use pastaOS
Install apps and other things into pastaOS
Use a product or install apps, plugins, extensions, or other things into a product

Can'ts:
Sell our OS without written consent from us
Modify our OS with the intent of ripping people off by selling a pastaOS-based bootleg or making a bootleg in any form
Share pastaOS without our written consent
Using our OS to break the law (this likely won't be easily enforced)
Modify our OS without our consent
Modify a product in any way without our consent
Make a bootleg off or sell a product without our consent.

Punishments:
Bootlegging, selling our OS or another product without our consent, sharing it without our consent, and breaking the law without our consent will either result in the end user's Pear ID being terminated and/or being reported to the proper authorities (most likely Pear ID termination), but an appeal can be made if one has enough non-dubious evidence that the end user should be unbanned (unbanning is unlikely considering our strict narrow reasons for approving appeal requests and unbanning the end user).

How to get consent:
You must contact the-new-devil@proton.me and wait for approval, although this is very seldom, and you must provide reasons for using the pastaOS code.

Clarifications:
We may need to clarify things. For one, you can indeed use our OS or another product as long as you don't modify our code nor sell it without our consent but you can also add apps and other things that are either under the Pear eLicense without modifying them or add apps that aren't under the Pear eLicense under the terms of the other license.
Hopefully this clarifies things.

About Jailbreaks:
We consider jailbreaking software like Sphynx to be unauthorized mods as they technically modify the OS without our consent in a way that isn't adding apps, plugins, and other programs with the official and/or Pear-supported methods.
